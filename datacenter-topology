#This topology consists of two Nokia SR Linux IXR-6e nodes running 22.6.4 release and connected with a single link over ethernet-1/1 interfaces.
# Each of the nodes comes up with a startup config which is sourced from srl-opeconfig.cfg.json file;
# the startup config contains a self-signed TLS cert and has gnmi, gnoi, gribi, p4rt services enabled
#
